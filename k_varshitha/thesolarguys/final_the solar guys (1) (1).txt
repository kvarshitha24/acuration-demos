An efficient and effective marketing plan can be put together in as little as one or as many as seven steps. Starting small and adding to the strategy as the business grows is an excellent way to get started. Solar power is no longer a niche investment for the rich, and a good digital marketing strategy can help increase awareness of its true costs and benefits. The solar industry is dominated by a few large installation companies, but small companies can rely on word of mouth and door-knocking to reach a wider audience. Solargraf offers NREL Certified solutions for solar marketing.

	Nine steps to help solar contractors command more value in the ...
	According to the study, 85% of solar considerers are still potential customers. Contractors can use a CRM (customer relationship management) tool to track ...
	The article discusses nine steps to help solar contractors command more value in the marketplace, including developing non-technical skills and understanding new demographics of solar customers. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently presented a webinar on how to increase lead generation and conversion rates in the residential solar sector. The article suggests techniques to cross the "chasm" between early adopters and pragmatists, including choosing a target market, positioning products, crafting a marketing strategy, and choosing the right distribution channel and pricing. Soft skills, such as installation techniques and equipment integration know-how, are not traditionally focused on by solar contractors. Developing soft skills has not created much of a competitive advantage until now as margins in the industry are compressing while the cost of solar is decreasing and consumer demand is turning back to direct ownership models. NREL also identified seven common mistakes that solar installers make, and the remaining recommendations from the NREL study are not summarized in the article. According to a study, 85 potential customers still use a CRM tool to contact potential solar contractors for growth opportunities.

	The solar industry is booming, but the jobs it is creating are not materializing as expected. In 2021, the solar industry employed 11 percent fewer people than it did five years earlier. The decline in jobs is due to an improvement in the speed with which developers install solar systems, increasing investment in large-scale solar farms, and technological advancements. In California's San Joaquin Valley, developers are now able to build a solar farm many times larger than they did a decade ago with only a marginal increase in workers. The increase in productivity comes as President Joe Biden seeks to shift the nation's energy sector away from fossil fuels. The declining jobs and rising efficiency could have profound implications in Houston, where fossil fuels have long driven the local economy, raising questions around whether there will be enough clean energy jobs to replace those lost in oil and coal.

There are three alternative technological approaches: trough systems, power tower systems, and dish/engine systems. Trough systems use large, U-shaped reflectors that heat the oil inside to boil water, which makes steam to run conventional steam turbines and generators. Power tower systems use many large, flat heliostats to track the sun and focus its rays onto a receiver, which heats a fluid, such as molten salt, as hot as 1,050°F. Molten salt retains heat efficiently, so it can be stored for days before being converted into electricity.

	Going solar: To debt, or not to debt - Alan
	Kind of like a mortgages, solar finance companies give you ranges of rate options. You can “buy down” your interest rate by paying upfront costs ...
	The author, Alan Johnson, is considering installing solar panels on his house but finds financing options difficult due to high interest rates. He compares the financed monthly cost with the cost offset from running the system and the credits he would get from his state. Going solar directly offsets utility expenses, so there is no need to think too deeply about time until return on investment. Solar finance companies offer ranges of rate options, but today's prime rate is about 8.25%, which makes financing much trickier. The author assumes that he will prepay the loans by overpaying and by looking to refinance in the future. With low rate debt, he would let the debt ride and let the system produce pure cash with no cost, which is the moment of positive return-on-investment. However, with significant interest rates, prepaying the loan becomes a disadvantage if you may want to overpay the monthly payment, refininance the loan when rates drop, or sell the house. The effect is worse the earlier in the term of the loan you prepay.

Solar energy warms Earth, causes wind and weather, and sustains plant and animal life.

	Are solar panels more effective at different locations on Earth?
		These factors are latitude, cloud cover, aerosols, elevation and shading. Not surprisingly, the site with the highest solar energy potential on Earth happens to be near the equator, surrounded by an arid climate away from major sources of pollution, and it also happens to be on a plateau.
		Where is the best location on Earth for solar energy? - WhatNextNow
		The Atacama Desert in Chile is the best location on Earth for solar energy due to its proximity to the equator, arid climate, and lack of major sources of pollution. It is a plateau on the west side of the Andes mountains and covers a strip of land about 1,000 kilometres long. A 5kW system of residential solar photovoltaic systems would yield around 11,000 kWh of electricity throughout the year, which is very close to the average household electricity consumption in North America. The absence of significant human presence in the area also means less industrial and urban pollution, limiting the level of aerosols in the air. The region hosts some of the top observatories in the world, including the European Southern Observatory. The top five factors that influence the solar energy potential of a site are latitude, cloud cover, aerosols, elevation, and shading. Solar energy production has to be balanced to meet the demand pattern using batteries or a grid connection.

	How does solar optimizer work?
		Power optimizers are essentially DC-DC converters, taking the DC power from a solar panel at whatever voltage and current is optimal (via MPPT), then converting that to a different voltage and current that best suits the central / string inverter.
		Power optimizer - Wikipedia
		The power optimizer is a technology developed to maximize energy harvest from solar panels or wind turbines by individually tuning the performance of the panel or wind turbine through maximum power point tracking. It is useful when power generating components in a distributed system will vary widely, such as due to differences in equipment, shading of light or wind, or being installed facing different directions or widely separated locations. Power optimizers for solar applications can be similar to microinverters in that both systems attempt to isolate individual panels in order to improve overall system performance. The claimed advantage to this "hybrid" approach is lower overall system costs, avoiding the distribution of electronics. Most energy production or storage devices have a complex relationship between the power they produce, the load placed on them, and the efficiency of the delivery. Solar panels have similar issues due to the speed at which the cell can convert solar photons into electrons, ambient temperature, and other issues.

	Richard Matsui from TD Cowen Insights discusses the potential of nuclear power as a way to scale down the cost curve of solar energy. He notes that the US nuclear fleet is largely comprised of unique designs and compares it to a gambler in a casino full of one-armed bandits. The multi-armed bandit problem is an old problem in probability theory that applies well to climate technologies with unknown future cost curves. In the early days of solar, there was an alphabet soup of competing technologies, including CPV, CSP, GaAs, a-Si, CIGS, and OPV. China Inc. has a 5-year national plan for solar power, but it is not spread evenly across the industry. The Chinese government has not spread its plan widely, making it difficult for the solar industry to spread it across the country.

Companies have invested billions of dollars in producing content on social media to build audiences around their brands, but consumers haven't shown up. Social media has weakened certain branding techniques by uniting once-isolated communities into influential crowdcultures, which produce their own content. Crowdcultures grease the wheels for an alternative approach, cultural branding, where a brand promotes a new ideology that springs from the crowd. Companies like Chipotle, Axe, and Dove have successfully used this approach to break through in culture. However, firms can't identify critical opportunities by relying on traditional segmentation and trend reports.

	Top 10 Strategies for Effective Solar Energy Marketing
	Put up signs advertising new solar installations. Your clients will be proud to display them, and the neighbors just might go green out of envy.
	The demand for solar energy is increasing due to concerns over global warming and reducing energy costs. Solar power is a clean and renewable source of energy, but many solar installation businesses struggle to get new leads due to competition. To effectively market solar energy, solar providers need to show clients the money, sell the environmental benefits of solar, make solar cool, and ask more questions. Showing clients the overall savings offered by going solar can improve conversion rates, and scheduling marketing efforts to coincide with local utility due dates can also help. Consumers choose solar for different reasons, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to yield optimal results. To sell anything effectively, you have to know what motivates your clients. To do that, you need to have solid answers to their questions about the real environmental benefits and the environmental impact of the production of solar products. To help solar providers, they need to actively seek out clients who are interested in solar energy and offer them information about their services and products.

	The world's largest desert, the Sahara, could be transformed into a giant solar farm, capable of meeting four times the world's current energy demand. However, this could have unintended climate consequences, such as raising temperatures across the globe and causing devastating droughts in the Amazon. Solar panels absorb most of the sunlight that reaches them, but only a fraction of the incoming energy gets converted to electricity. The panels are usually much darker than the ground they cover, so a vast expanse of solar cells will absorb a lot of additional energy and emit it as heat, affecting the climate. A 2018 study used a climate model to simulate the effects of lower albedo on the land surface of deserts caused by installing massive solar farms. The model revealed that when the size of the solar farm reaches 20% of the total area of the desert, it triggers a feedback loop, creating a steep temperature difference between the land and the surrounding oceans. This scenario might seem fanciful, but studies suggest that a similar feedback loop kept much of the Sahara green during the African Humid Period.
